### Whisper

Achieves darkness in communication at high computational cost.
- off-chain communication protocol
- part of the ethereum ecosystem as a gossip protocol
- propagation does not stop at the recipient, each message is always broadcast to every node
- uses proof of work to avoid network spam

**Advantages**
- Decntralized, Ephemeral identities, built-in steganography, darkness

**Constraints**
- High latency, traffic, processor load, memory usage

**Structure**
- Expiry, TTL, Topic, NONCE, Encrypted payload

**Topic**
4 bytes of arbitrary data needed for plausible deniability
- will be used in v6 for routing, reduce darkness but also improve network performance

Recipient needs to forward all messages, Sender needs to maintain noise to obfuscate real and fake messages.
- You should use different keys and topics for incoming and outgoing messages.
- Messages are padded so as to not leak metadata of the length of the payload.
- Provides symmetric as well as asymmetric encryption
- Long term key for establishing sessions, and session (ephemeral) keys are used instead of digital signatures

**Steganography**
- Random padding used by default
- Can be substituted with a secret message

**Protocol**
- Implementation agnostic, so a private network can be setup.Trusted participants -> no need for PoW and small number of nodes -> no bandwidth constraints
- Cannot substitute whisper encryption with custom encryption, however it can be used on top of whisper encryption

### Swarm City

Allow people to interact, transact, and hsare without the need of a central party/middleman
1. IPFS consortium
2. Gas station

**IPFS**

Need to find a way for data persistence: "I'll pin your data if you pin mine"
1. `IPFSProxy.sol` smart contract allows a IPFS consortium
- two functions: addHash and removeHash
2. Each IPFS node needs to run ProxyListener.js

Look into `IPFSEvents` contract, once events are fired, other nodes will also be able to start listening for addHash and removeHash events

3. multiMember(multisig) vote on adding new members All member pledge to persist each other's data. Allocate an equal amount of disk space as participants

FUTURE: Pinning may be able to happen via Whisper

**Permissionless Network**: Scripts can be run on any computer!

**Gas Station**

"One click solution to get gas in any ERC20 contract"

Want people to be able to use their tokens to get the gas necessary to use their tokens.

`GasStation.sol`
- Deposit ether into the gas station, specify the token you want to support
- Consults the exchange rate of ether to token
- `pushFill` `pullFill`

`gasStationService.js`
- Calculate the wei for the transaction

### Regen Network

Decentralized ecological knowledge network that will reverse climate change by incentivizing regenerative agriculture by creating a large ecological data network and a token that incentivizes regenerative actions

Carbon Farming -- Regenerative agriculture

**Incentivizing Regenerative Action**
1. Proof of Regeneration via decentralized verification
- Validation of claim and outcome, location, identity, data authenticity, and data integrity
2. Circulating token supply limited by Reverse Mining Protocol

**Streamr Integration**

Need a lot of IoT devices as data sources

Sensor data to REGEN via Streamr
1. IoT sends data points through farmOS to streamr which then routes the network to RN

Data can be subscribed to by other interested third parties

> Only farmers can mine the tokens, puts farmers back at the center of the economy as providers of the base layer of wealth to society

### DAO IPCI

Blockchain ecosystem for carbon markets, environmental mitigation

Implement a token to defragment the dozens of units used today for carbon credits

### IDBox

1.5 billion people in the world today lack official identification, mostly countries where you have no internet, no electricity ad no smartphones

- Cost efficient device that does not require internet or grid electricity to create a unique identity
- People only need a basic analogue phone to create a unique identity

### Alice

Transparent donations platform, live at alice.si
- Give to a social project, see exactly what impact your money Makes
- if it doesn't make an impact, you get your money back

1. Donation gets held in smart contract escrow
2. Charity starts running projects and delivering goals
3. Only when the goals are independantly validated (greater authority) do the funds get distributed

Focuses on credit card donations, remove the complexity of crypto

Account is setup on registration with fiat tokenization of donated funds

Registrations happens on a virtual wallet, classic db, as well as the ethereum chain

**We can probably integrate with their donation platform. I think this is highly feasible.**

The broad vision of alice is to expand to grant-giving. Impact investments on the rise.

**Evolutions**
1. Projects should be broken down by 5 dimensions (check out Impact Management Project: building a framework for how to measure and manage impact)
  - Rewarded for providing reports, penalized if not by having donations withheld
  - **TRACK THE IMPACT, NOT THE MONEY**
2. Want to incentivie data analytics across different projects, and create a  prediction market based on the regular update reports
3. Impact investing platform

**Just pubished whitepaper, check it out**

### Colony

The people layer of the blockchain ecosystem based on reputation - requires context

**Reputation**
Stored off-chain for each sub-domain/skill
Hashed and merklized, where root hash is stored on-chain
Reputation is mined to validate the correctness of reputation

**False submissions**
JustificationRootHash, there's a first step of disagreement from previously know root hash, to the proposed new hash. At one point, disagreement is found nad the faulty party loses staked CLNY tokens.

Reputation system allows us to fine tune the incentives of all the actors in a Colony, to reward good behaviour and penalize bad behaviour in a non-economic way

### Kleros

Arbitration of smart contracts in a decentralized court.

### Streamr

Building a decentralized data sharing economy. A participant can collect data, publish it to the network, and instantly be received by interested subsribers

Sharded architecture with off-chain companion network that writes to the ethereum chain for key facts

**You own, monetize, and deliver your data**

Streamr on top of Ethereum with a marketplace on top as well as a streamr engine with an editor to piece together data sources for visualization to seemlessly combine various data streams

**Editor**
Connect streams(public transport demo) with visual interfaces (map) to visualize live data but also feed the data into SMART CONTRACTS (WHAT?)
- Eg. when you hit certain threshold (of distance travelled by public transpot), you commit a transaction on the the chain (pay an amount to the transportation company)

**THIS SHIT IS FUCKING DOP ASS SHIT**

Imagine a world where hundreds of sensors are installed in a vehicle, where data is delivered in real time to an application which were communicated to the blockchain. A consuming application retrieved that information and were then delivered to a consuming party.

**Think of decentralized Kinesis and Lambda**

Imagine a box that hosts an application powered on top of Streamr client and Ethereum client amongst other services that provide a completely decentralized computation container.
