- Interface with Status, Walleth, look into using this (good opportunity to learn GO)

Swarm
- decentralized mass storage and high-bandwidth communication between nodes

Whisper
- secure, decentralized communication protocol between nodes

Web3.js // EVM 1.5

Wifi Password ???

### Coin Center
Regulatory Update

 - Independant nonprofit based in washington DC concerned with crypto policies
 - Engage in public education, policy research (regulatory frameworks) and advocating for what sort of laws and frameworks should be put into place


 ##### Uniform Law Commission
 - Model state act for regulation of virtual cryptocurrency business (transplant bitlicense)

 - No need to get licensed unless you hold control over another individual's cryptocurrency / or using on own behalf **includes hosting a token launch**

 - GET THE MODEL ACT PASSED

 - Developing a capital gains tax exemption for cryptocurrency (any transaction below 600 dollars don't need to be taxed) H.R. 3708


 ##### Securities Cryptocurrency frameworks
 - DAO report -> check it out!
 - DAO tokens should NOT be considered Securities

**Look up video of dude explaining Zcash and ethereum masterfully in 2 minutes**

##### Token regulations
- Securities regulations
  - Is the thing being sold as an investment?
  - Is there a person upon whom investors rely to create the thing?
    - Compare Gold to Apple stock
- Anti-money laundering regulations
  - Is the token being used as a currency substitute
  - Is there a centralized issuer who can also withdraw from circulation
- Investment vs Utility (Why is the thing valuable)
  - Money goes in, more money comes out
  - Money goes in, service comes out
- Issuer vs Network (What creates that value?)
  - User onboarding vs public key cryptocurrency
  - Accounting vs blockchain
  - Management oversight vs miners

### Ethereum in 25 minutes VITALIK

"Tour through the depths of the Merkle Underworld"
Blockchain with built-in general purpose programming language


**Two types of accounts**
- Contracts (controlled by code)
- and User accounts (controlled by private keys)

State - "current" information
- Account balances, Nonces, Contract code and contract storage

History - Things that have happened

**Transactions**
- Every transaction specifies a transaction operation address to send to
- Code can: Send ETH to contracts, Read/write storage, Call other contracts
- Every full node on the blockchain processes every transaction and stores the entire State

Halting problem - cannot tell whether or not a program will run infinitely

Gas - charge fee per computational step, special gas fees also applied to operations that take up storage

Transactions - Nonce, gasprice, startgas, to, value, data, v, r, s

**Logs**
- append-only not readable by contracts
- 10x cheaper than storage
- Bloom filter, up to 4 topics, put into merkle treee
- Use to figure out what's been happening

**EVM** - Stack, memory (temporary data existing ephmerealy), storage (contract permanent storage), Environment variables (block number etc.), logs, sub-calling (internal transactions to call other contracts)

**ABI** - function calls are compiled into transaction data -> first 4 bytes function ID, next 32 bytes first argument, next 32 second argument

**Merkle Trees**
- Singlehandedly make light clients possible (he made us bow down lmfao)
- Allows for efficiently verifiable proofs that a transaction was included in a block
- For any given piece of data in the tree, make a merkle branch, check the hashes against each other to ensure the data belongs in the tree -- take a piece of data and build up the tree
- Used in ethereum to prove that transactions are in a block, as well as in the state tree (represents the entire state of the blockchain) -- State Root
- Light client can ask the networks for a merkle branch for a particular account, check the branch from the top to the bottom, and if everything matches then it knows that the specific data is valid

**Byzantium**
**Privay Features - ELLIPTICURVE COMPUTATIONS**
- Ring signatures
- ZK SNARKS
- Big number exponentiation (think: RSA)
- Makes private applications and transactions possible
Static call opcode - pure functional programming
Revert opcodes that help you save gas and make the EVM more efficient

**Future Directions**
Casper, Sharding, EVM and other protocol upgrades
Second layer solutions (eg. Plasma, privacy preserving protocols)

### Primea

Ewasm - Webassembly instruction Set, Metering of Webassembly
Webassembly more performant, more expensible, and more compatible thant EVM

Currently Ethereum can't process transactions concurrently
Primea focuses on protoyping ideas on concurrency
- Uses the actor Model
- Inter process communications
- Microkernel
- concurrently
- Deterministic
- Built in conjunction with dfinity

Sits above instructions sets but below consensus, can support herterogenous instructions sets (WASM, JS, x86) - provides communication across all instruction sets

Current blockchain computers are not performant, not scalable, and ad-hoc design

### Light clients (Parity)
Checks validity of headers, but does not check validity of state transitions (transaction execution, block reward)

Attacks involve tricking the user into making an action by showing them a wrong state

**Network Protocol Goals**
- Minimuze rount trips and bandwidth
  - Backreferencing
    - Reduces the need for rounttrip requests, have a single request reference other information that will be needed and transfer as a single packet

**Provable data**
- State Proofs
  - Request an entire transaction proof from a peer
  - Prove cases where we can execute from a cached state

**Avoid DoS of protocol servers**
- Request Credits
  - Serving nodes give peers credits that can be used to make requests
  - Credits recahrge slowly over time
  - Different requests have different costs
  - Server gather data on request serving times and adapt costs

Requires full nodes to serve the light clients, need an incentive scheme!
Pay per header vs pay per unit of gas

**Block Pruning Proposal ??**
- All nodes currently store the entire chain
- Light clients can use Canonical hash tries so as to store almost nothing
- Condense a tree into a single 32 byte hash to represent block headers merkle tree

Can prune the amount of blocks each node needs to store, by having a cyclical peer structure where each n id'd node serves a specific n'th block in a batch that it is assigned

**RPC pitfalls**

eth_getLogs can be very expensive especially for all logs in history, fine if you are simply watching the head of the chain

eth_get*ByHash is ok for recent data, but hashed by design leak no information about the block number, must ask a full node (which needs to store an expensive index)

eth_estimateGas uses a binary search to determine how much it will take for the transaction to succeed which may require proving a transaction multiple times. Trade-off between accuracy and cost. Think about how you are writing your smart contract when itnended for use by light clients

Can run Parity with --light flag in beta releases.

### Verifying Casper (ma nigga Yoichi)

Casper - name of the proof of stake protocol that Ethereum will be using.

Casper contract will exist on each fork with validators. They vote for blocks and the casper contract decides which block should get finalized. Validators get rewards or get their deposits taken away.

**Validator**
- votes for a block, by eah validator epoch, hash, and source (justification for vote)
- The epoch is the newest block to be validated. Once validated, that branch from source is solidified
- No double voting, don't vote on different epochs or different sources
- No 'surrounding'
- AVOID CONTRADICTIONS
- SOle responsibility, cannot be effected by actions of other Validators

**Justification and finalization**
- Weight of votes backed by amount of ether deposited
- When blocks are connected to the genesis block, they're justified
- Only justified block can be finalized

### Sikorka
Framework for smart contract proof of presence, making locations and objects programmable

- net work of detectors, different types of detectors chosen by security requirements
- Prove presence for bureaucratic, customer loyalty, augmented reality, and objects interacting with smart contracts

Detectors types chosen by developer. Eg. temporal bluetooth (BLE) tracker providing location accuracy up to 20 meters that is privacy preserving. Or flashing QR code displayer that a user needs to scan to sign their transaction.

Smart contracts - Registry and interface to integrate with registry

### Julia
Intermediate language for ethereum contracts

Problems with solidity compiler - extremely hard to audit, a lot of helpers and optimisations in solidity, porting solidity to other VMs

**Modern Compiler**

- Front end parses, analyses and creates intermediate representation of source code
- Middle end - optimizes the intermediate representations
- Back end - generates the bytecode, and also some optimisations

**Julia introduces a middle end to EVM compilation**
Parse solidity, generate Julia, optimise Julia, compile EVM, optimise EVM

Julia helps auditing
- as opposed to someone who is reviewing C++
- allows for a single framework of optimisations

Different Backends: EVM EVM1.5 eWASM JS C etc.

### Smart Contract Package Management

ETHPM, ERC190
Specifies a format of a JSON document to specify the package contents and how to build

LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT TRUFFLE ALREADY HAS, BUT STANDARDIZED

Also really good for verification of contracts as well as wallets

### Cryptoeconomics - programmable incentives

Open Access + trusted execution provides programmable Money

Blockchains give us programmable money, programmable money -> programmable incentives, programmable incentives -> program people

Want fast finality, decentralized control vs slow and centralized

**Create Mechanism**
**Analyzing Incentives**
- incentivize all players
- Make assumptions, if they hold true, analyze outcome
**Deploy**
- Code, open source / verify, deploy
**Learn**
**Share**

### Truebit

Bringing computation to blockchain, a scalability solution for computation - interactive verification

Focused on large transactions.

**Verifier's dilemma**
Smart contracts process small computations ONLY, length of computation is constrained by Ethereum's gas limit.
- Gaslimit incentivizes transaction verification

1. Skipping verification affords an advantage in the mining race
2. Minig the wrong chain means that other miners will ignore the found block
Miners want todo what the other miners are doing

Truebit wants to perform majority of computation off-chain, and verify it's correctness

Truebit is a unanimous consensus algorithm. A court with miners as judges is used to settle challenges to the solution. Binary search is used to find point of disagreement.

Solvers back their solution with a deposit which will be forfeited if it is challenged and found wrong

**Forced Errors**
Offer a bug bounty and provide expectation that bugs will exist. This is true bit. With the expectation that there will always be an error, people are incentivized to always verify solutions for reward

Look into panopticomputers, behave correctly because you think you are constantly being watched.

**Uniformity and simplicity**

Three properties must be true on the Truebit Virtual Machine
1. Tasks must compile and execute identically on all machines
2. A single computation step on the TVM runs comfortable across all platforms
3. damnit

### Plasma

Building blockchains on blockchains.
1. Initialize the plasma blockchain - write contracts and submit to root chain
2. Localized Computation - periodic commitments submitted to root chain
3. Consensus rules defined in fraud proofs - rollback invalid blocks

Periodically commit block hashes onto the chain, which can encompass a lot of data off-chain

An incorrect block can be verified fraudulent since the consensus rules are written in the smart contracts. Challenges occur on chain

**Core novelty of Plasma is around exiting in events of data unavailability**

Allows trees of blockchains, blockspaces, computational scaling, all with a single commit to the main chain.

Potential to map reduce chains. Need to figure out how the ledger scales.
