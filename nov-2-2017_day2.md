### Status

Catalonia held election, however most voters were connecting through HTTPS through their browser which was easy for the Spanish Government to block.

Status wants to build decentralized p2p messenger on top of Ethereum.

**Educate when necessary**

Eg, only tell users to back up key once it stores something of value

**Hardware Wallet**

New initiative. Open source java card(?) can be used to sign transactions, as well as interface with mobile phone to do the same.

**Discover Search**

Cache of messages shared across clients

Want to build multiple layers of trust. First is when a status is shared it is signed by the propagator.

**Uses whisper for communication**

Super private, but both peers required to be online for the channel to be created

If one offline, sender continuously signs the message until the receiver comes online before they can receive the message.

Status is proposing a decentralized server to store the offline servers that will store signed transactions and route appropriately through push notifications / chat protocols

**WANT TO EXTEND SERVICE TO MACOS AND WINDOWS**

Will allow anyone to host these servers through their phone/laptop/desktop

OpenBounty platform allows people to take a git issue and vreate a bounty for completing that issue. openbounty.status.im (SUPER INTERESTING)

### LOOK INTO IEXEC THEY ARE AWESOME DOPE SHIT

### JUZIX

Chinese blockchain company - Shanghai, Shenzhen

**Juice**

Enterprise Platform built on ethereum

Launched blockchain open source in China

Enterprise-Class PBFT optimized on Ethereum, can add and remove nodes dynamically - beleive that PBFT is the best solution for now

Look into ZK-Proofs

These guys are legit...they are even writing modifications in the EVM, they have a huge suite of integrations and enterprise solutions. They are a fork of ethereum offering multi

### EVM

Static flow is easy to perform formal analysis and compilation because the paths increase linearly to functions, however in a decentralized network they grow quadratically

EVMJIT beats C++ for 256 bit-calculations

Two research programs to improve EVM - EVM 1.5 and EVM 2.0

**1.5**

Suggestion to extend the current EVM by adding new OP codes and subroutines

- Forbids unconstrained jumps, opcodes for subroutines, opcodes for native scalar and SIMD vector types
  - A lot of silicon hardware available for SIMD processes that EVM doesn't take advantage of
- Validate control flow and stack discipline and type safety of systems

**2.0**

Looks like a high level language with if-else

- provides opcodes for structured control flow, subroutines, and ""

**JITs are exploitable**

If you write a contract that takes a long time to compile, but very little gas to run, you can cause a DoS attack. Compiling needs to happen upfront, not just in time. Compile at deployment, not at runtime.

All versions can be transpiled to each other, and transpilers can live on the blockchain

### Ethereum security

EVM forensics, managing attacks agains the network, tools and strategies

In Cryptoland, everyone is a target and mistakes have huge consequences
For attackers it's disneyland - small efforts, high rewards, low risks

**Shanghai Attacks**

One month of attacks against Geth

Some issues with transaction propagation inefficiencies, brought down overall network transaction by an order of magnitude by blocking invalid transaction propagation

How do you analyze a transaction if the transaction crashed my node?
Use a local EVM
1. get pre-state info about sender and receiver
2. Execute in EVM

Jumpdest request is pretty cool, Retromix an awesome tool

**Consensus Issue**

Need more coverage for Byzantium

Generate random testcases, execute on each EVM, compare internal state op-by-op and representation

Millions and billions of tests against all clients - more thoroughly tested than ever before


### Swarm

Network of computers that share data in a decentralized way - p2p decentralized Network

Swarm uses the same p2p connections as the ethereum network

Some usecases
1. Decentralized store of app data (images, html etc.)
  - bzz is a swarm protofcol
  - ENS turns name.eth to hash
  - Use hash to query peers for data
  - Whoever provides data is compensated with micro payment

**Under the hood**

File broken into 4k chunks, everything is hashed, merklized and returns root hash
Each chunk gets distributed to different nodes to be stored, keyed by hash.
Uniformly stored in the swarm network

**SWAP protocol**

- If there is an imbalance between nodes, a payment must be made to maintain balance
- There is a payment threshold. Nodes in debt need to issue cheque to peers to maintain balance
- If you slide too far to the side, you get disconnected

Livepeer is using Swarm to provide live stream broadcasting

**PSS**

Uses Kademlia as routing overlay for data storage and retrieval
- If we can use swarm to send bits and pieces of files around, why not use it to send messages
- Since swarm is routed it can deliver messages faster with minimum network load (not secure)
- POSTAL SWARM SERVICE
- Uses the notion of topics, any 4 byte value
  - One one knows the topic of the message, it knows what to do with it
- Expiry parameter to stop a message from circulating perpetually
- Supports asymmetric and symmetric cryptography

KEY, TOPIC, ADDRESS

**Testing**

Browser based UI of swarm network to visualize what's going on and input changes and simulate activity

Use docker to run a cluster of nodes and run them on production-level
Can simulate production environment vs a simulated test environment

Want to test emergent behaviour of the client instead of testing how a client is expected to behave

Want to be able to test protocols, to test the entire network as opposed to the individual node

**Roadmap**

- Want to change the hashing algorithm (use merkle tree)
- Rewrite how nodes sync with each other (used to be non-performant and was error-prone)
- Entire network layer has been rewritten

**BREAKING CHANGES, NEED TO UPDATE**

### Dapp on Swarm and ENS

Heavy leaf processing of the network.
- local front end with web3 Support
- native mobile app
- IoT device

Distributed, generic backend
- ETH/LES for consensus
- BZZ for state data
- PSS/SHH for communication

Consumers (think leechers)
- Spend account units (ether or tokens)
- High Churn
- Limited resources

Suppliers (think seeders)
- Earn accountint units
- Low Churn
- High availability
- Adequate resources

**Scaling**

Some big bottlenecks
- Blockchain (info on each node, requirement for immediate full ordering of events, requires fast broadcast of transactions and blocks)
- Individual nodes
- Network links (network-wide broadcasts)

Overcoming Storage bottlenecks
- Keep data in swarm and store root hash in ENS
Overcoming Transaction bottlenecks
- Use a raiden-style update for ENS resolvers
Overcoming Broadcast bottlenecks
- Use of PSS with pub/sub model, make sure that you won't be burdening the entire network with huge broadcasts

**Tradeoffs between responsiveness and consistency**
Blockchain provides eventual consistency but it is slow, need to broadcast updates to the concerned nodes faster. Only update the blockchain only when it becomes important to have consensus.

**PAY ATTENTION TO INCENTIVES**

### Giveth -- the future of token contracts

**MiniMe**

ERC20 token that can create/destroy token, black list / white list KYC, stopping and sarting transfers

The balance distribution can be queried at any block in the past -- THE TOKEN IS CLONEABLE -- but gas costs are higher for transfers

KEY: It tracks the history of distribution on the blockchain

Can be used for governance applications / voting systems
Distribution of rewards to token holders is possible because you know the balanc eof any token holder at any time in the past

Upgradeabke and future proof -- ANYONE CAN CREATE A FORK OF THE TOKEN IN A PERMISSION-LESS WAY ALLOWING THEM TO ADD VALUE

Look into the ERC223 token standard - need to solve backward compatibility and implement pseudo-introspection standard (EIP 165, EIP 672)

**LiquidPledging**

Liquid Democracy meets Fund management -- Manage your tokens or let somebody else manae them with oversight

1. Full control of the money
2. Full transparency and auditability of the transactions
3. Extensible via plugins / added functionality

Can be used for organizational management, fund management, liquid lending

### FutureProof Smart Contracts (Aragon)

Decentralized organizations platform built on top of Ethereum
1. Usable by non-technical users
2. Allow extendabiliy of the system with third party on-chain modules

**Future Proofing**

1. DUmb contracts are hte best smart contracts
2. Optimize for gas savings
3. Remember that contracts need to be upgraded

GOAL: Cheap, upgradeable yet very simple contracts

**Case against upgradeability**

1. Trust is required if they can be arbitrarily changed, how do you be trust less?
2. Possibility of front running attack on upgrade

**Why you need to upgrade**

1. Young ecosystem to solve unanticipated bugs
2. To add new features

**Upgrades**

1. Do not rely on just one entity
2. Time delayed for vetting and auditing

Libraries are linked on compile times and can not upgraded after the fact
**Idea**: link to a proxy library which will allow you to change hte business logic post-deployment of the contract (Cannot modify ABI of the contract and data structures though)

**Delegate Proxy**

Delegate the logic within your contract to other contracts through delegate call (LOGIC MODULARIZED AND IS STORED IN OTHER CONTRACTS WHICH CAN BE REDEPLOYED AND POINTED TOWARDS)

1. Forwarders take advantage of small easy-to-deploy contracts
 - A delegate call is added to every transaction, and adds gas overhead to each run
 - Can be offset by reduced deployment costs of new contracts
2. Upgradeable Proxies
 - Inheritance causes problems in usage (storage needs to remain consistent)
 - Adding just one strage value will break all subsequent storage
 - Failure will be silent, should append storage at the end


**AragonOS**

Tiny Kernel contract keeps track of apps at the edges of the system, kernel points to them

App proxy interacts with kernel to know which version of the contract should be used

**ACL**

Purely address based whitelist

### EtherScan

Exploring the ethereum blockchain

Ether scan is a block explorer and search engineer for Ethereum blockchain
18m page views/month, 9b API balls/month

**Challenges in building an infrastrutcure level service**

Nodes Management

- Multiple client implementations with different feature sets and network robustness
- Geth and Parity (Geth for features such as remix, parity for rpc calls)

Node deployment strategies
- use SSD drives
- pay attention to cache settings
- monitor node response
- load balancers with smaller multiple nodes

**Deriving the Ethereum user Persona**
Huge increase in China, Russia, South Korea and decrease in US as percentage of all users

50% 25 - 35, 92% males


### Contract security

Be wary of implicit assumptions such as `this.balance = 0`, and external calls to 'secure' contracts. Find and question if the assumptions are valid.

**Advice**
1. Sometimes the code works as intended, but the mechanism behind it does not. You need to consider the malicious players and design for these situations.
2. Formal verification is cool, but need to think about game theory as well.
3. Know EVM details, and keep your code simple. Do not build huge inheritance structures that are easy to audit

Consensys has a best practices guide for contract auditing.

A good specification needs to highlight how the code functions, but also the assumptions that are made. Needs to be easy to understand and descriptive. It should also put the contract in a larger picture where we consider the players and larger network of both benevolent and malicious actors

### Hardware Security

Secure hardware brings an isolated environment for secrets and security sensitive operations
- allows code execution and physically resistant

Allows proof of execution on a given platform and of its health

Today's hardware platforms are not "secure", you are never generally in full control of your hardware

**Architecture**

Secret data, secure storage such as private keys through a transaction interface

This is isolated through a native system call with and application

**Components**

- Guarantee secure storage and implementation of cryptographic meterial and primitives
- Provide proof of execution for any application, verifiable on chain
- There is one more, missed it damn

NEED A COMMON, GENERIC TRANSACTION INTERFACE

**Open source crypto Libraries**
1. libsecp256k1
2. ctAES
3. uECC
4. libsodium

### Raiden Network

Requires JSONRpc for raiden client to communicate with Ethereum node, both are required to participate in the network

**microraiden**

Offchain payment channel framework, unidirectional many to one that allows fast and free off chain transactions

Can perform m2m payments (machine to machine) such as utilities to data storage to scheduled API calls (__token-fueled robots__)
